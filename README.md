## About The Project

In my project, I analyzed the "official" casualty from the beginning of the war (October 7th, 2023) up to March 19th, 2024, for 165 days, to find inconsistency and attempt to decieve truth.

### Key Features

- **Visualization:** prooving visually how "only in Gaza", men have died in negative daily counts.
- **Statistics:** Using statistics, including Pearson, Benford's Law and asking statistical questions to determine how impossible are the "official" data.

### Built With

This project is brought to life using Python and a host of libraries designed for data manipulation, and visualization, including:

- Pandas & NumPy for data wrangling
- Matplotlib, Seaborn & Plotly for data visualization

## Getting Started

To explore this project and run the models yourself, you'll need to set up your environment and install the necessary dependencies.

### Prerequisites

- A Python environment (recommendation: use [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual) for easy management)
- Installation of the required libraries:
  
  ```bash
  pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn

### Installation

1. Clone the repo
   ```sh
